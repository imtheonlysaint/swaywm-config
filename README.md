# My SwayWM Configuration

This is my personal repository for my configuration files (dotfiles) for [Sway](https://swaywm.org/), an i3-compatible tiling Wayland compositor.

This configuration is designed to be lightweight, functional, and aesthetic, with tight integration between key components for a cohesive desktop experience.


---

## Key Features

* **Dynamic Theming**: Uses **[wallust](https://github.com/wallust/wallust)** to automatically generate a color palette from your wallpaper. This theme is then applied to Waybar and other components.
* **Modern Status Bar**: A custom configuration for **[Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar)** that displays system information, workspaces, time, and more in a clean style.
* **Fast App Launcher**: Uses **[fuzzel](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/fuzzel)** as the primary application launcher, a modern dmenu/rofi replacement for Wayland.
* **Notification Center**: Uses **[swaync](https://github.com/ErikReider/swaync)** for advanced notification management, complete with a "Do Not Disturb" mode and history panel.

## Dependencies

Here are the main components required for this configuration to work properly.

* **Window Manager**: `sway`
* **Wallpaper**: `swaybg` (or `swww`)
* **Status Bar**: `waybar`
* **App Launcher**: `fuzzel`
* **Notification Daemon**: `swaync`
* **Theming Engine**: `wallust`
* **Terminal**: (e.g., `kitty`, `alacritty`, or `foot`)
* **Font**: A **Nerd Font** (e.g., [JetBrainsMono Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)) is highly recommended to display icons correctly on Waybar.
